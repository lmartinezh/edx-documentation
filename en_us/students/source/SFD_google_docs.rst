Google Docs and Calendars
##############################

Some courses include Google docs, such as text documents,
spreadsheets, and presentations. Your course might also include a Google
calendar. Google docs and calendars appear in the body of your
course just like any other course content. 

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries. 
 If Google services are not available in your area, a black box appears in the
 place of the Google document or calendar. Your instructor might provide
 alternative resources if Google services are not available for you.

You can interact with Google docs in a course. For example, you can complete
forms, page through the slides in a presentation, and enter different values in
a spreadsheet. However, you cannot change the content of a Google doc.

***********************
Google Calendar
***********************

If your course includes a Google calendar, you can view that calendar in the
course or add it to your own Google calendar.

By default, the calendar view that opens is the calendar view that the
instructor set. You can click the **Week**, **Month**, or **Agenda** tabs in the
upper-right corner to change the view.

When you view the calendar in your course, the times on the calendar reflect
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not your local time. The time zone information
for the calendar appears in the lower-left corner of the screen. 

If you add the calendar to your own Google calendar, the times and dates adjust
automatically to your local time. To add the calendar to your own calendar,
click the **Google Calendar** icon in the lower-right corner of the calendar.
